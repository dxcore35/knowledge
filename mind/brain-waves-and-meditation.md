# Brain waves & meditation



![](../.gitbook/assets/mediationbrainwaves_cover.png)

## PROBLEMS

* Further studies have been suggested to consider extra frequency ranges and cross-correlation between EEG signals
* There is hundreds of meditation style so there is no fixed correlation
* Some researchers have criticized the traditional approach of investigating strictly defined frequency bands while ignoring the functional interplay between frequencies. This critical view is well justified, because there is hardly any doubt that different frequencies interact in some way and represent different aspects of brain processes. However, so far, there is **no global brain theory in sight.**
* Also meditation effects on the brain activity measured by EEG could be contaminated by the electromuscular artifacts. EEG rhythms show 6 times less power in 25–30 Hz band and 100 times less 40–100 Hz power in paralyzed subjects.
* Interference

**Interference** is a phenomenon in which 2 waves superpose to form a resultant wave of greater / lower/ the same amplitude.

The interesting point is that the traditional EEG frequency bands can be explained by a frequency architecture that is centered around alpha-band activity. The assumption is that the alpha frequency domain, as a basic process of the conscious brain, interacts best with those frequency domains that have a harmonic relationship with the alpha domain and that the separation between frequency domains is obtained with frequency ratios equaling the golden mean. It is a consequence of this assumption to expect that the frequency architecture changes when consciousness changes.

## ALPHA

Research shows that increases in alpha power are generally not reliable markers of meditative states. Increases of alpha power have been observed in tasks requiring the redirection of attention towards internal objects. Alpha frequency was also shown to be correlated to cognitive performance, including the speed at which information is retrieved from memory. A positive correlation between fast and accurate memory performance and alpha frequency was found. Alpha wave activity may also improve word recognition in older adults as well as facilitate working memory. Along with cognitive benefits, elevations in alpha wave activity have also been associated with an increased perception of calmness. Upper alpha band \(∽10–13 Hz\) .

To be it more difficult the spectrum is divided to:

* **Alpha-1 \(Low alpha, 6.9–8.9 Hz\):** inner-awareness of self, mind/body integration, balance
* **Alpha-2 \(Mid-range alpha, 8.9–10.9 Hz\):**
* **Alpha-3 \(High alpha, 10.9–12.9 Hz\)**: specifically reflects encoding memory processes

When the subjects opened their eyes, the EEG frequency increased to beta and gamma, and alpha waves were “blocked.” Alpha blocking is considered to be a signal of orientation or interest.

## **THETA**

These types of waves likely originate from a relaxed attention that monitors our inner experiences. Here lies a significant difference between meditation and relaxing without any specific technique. Previous studies have shown that theta waves indicate deep relaxation and occur more frequently in highly experienced meditation practitioners. The source is probably frontal parts of the brain, which are associated with monitoring of other mental processes. These oscillations assist with alertness and the ability to process information quickly. A research study showed that higher theta wave activity was identified in individuals with the lowest anxiety.

> Alpha and theta \(4–7 Hz\) are now known to be involved in many different waking tasks in many parts of the brain. In many cases these near–10 Hz waves seem to coordinate faster oscillations. In a very broad sense, near–10 Hz waves may function as a widespread “system clock” for many parts of the brain. Boundary between theta and alpha is not necessarily clear, and some researchers believe that these waves are not necessarily stable in their conventional range. It has been theorized that a typical EEG signature of meditation can be increase in theta, alpha band power, decrease in at least alpha frequency, and spread of alpha coherence across cortex, its realization needs further research.

## GAMA

Positive correlations between gamma power and the length of lifetime open-awareness meditation. It is a marker of an overall attentive state, the parietal cortex being associated with the focus of attention on a given object. It is also the frequency band associated with rapid eye movement a feature of dream-state sleep, which corresponds with visual perception and delta activity.

> Low-gamma \(25–45 Hz\) and theta \(4–8 Hz\) oscillations are proposed to underpin the integration of phonemic and syllabic information.

## BETA

Beta waves are high-frequency, low-amplitude brain waves that are commonly observed in an awaken state. They are involved in conscious thought and logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating effect. Having the right amount of beta waves allows us to focus. 

* **Beta-1 \(Low beta, 12–15 Hz\)**: associated mostly with quiet, focused, introverted concentration
* **Beta-2 \(Mid-range beta, \(15–20 Hz\)**: associated with increases in energy, anxiety, and performance
* **Beta-3 \(High beta, 18–40 Hz\)**: associated with significant stress, anxiety, paranoia, high energy, and high arousal.

## DELTA

Delta waves are the slowest recorded brain waves in human beings. Although delta can be active during transcendent states, it is most associated with deep sleep and it is normal and important component of adult sleep. Adequate production of delta waves helps us feel completely rejuvenated and promotes the immune system, natural healing, and restorative/deep sleep.The wider literature suggests that meditative states are distinctly different than sleep states; given prevalent whole brain activation that reflects typical waking consciousness. It is shown that normal resting is associated with increased delta and theta waves compared to meditative states. Increases in delta power were also reported during semantic tasks in children. The origin of delta waves during cognitive processes remains unknown. It has been hypothesized that low frequency oscillations of delta and theta ranges are associated with motivational and emotional processes. Considerable evidence confirms a link between theta activity and emotional states both in animals and in humans.

There is also a new evidence that shows that types of meditation that developed out of certain traditions such as Vajrayana and Hindu Tantric lead to heightened sympathetic activation and phasic alertness, while types of meditation from other traditions such as Theravada and Mahayana elicit heightened parasympathetic activity and tonic alertness. Such findings validate Buddhist scriptural descriptions of heightened arousal during Vajrayana practices and a calm and alert state of mind during Theravada and Mahayana types of meditation and demonstrate the importance of the cultural and philosophical context out of which the meditation practices develop.
