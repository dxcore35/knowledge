# Isometric exercise

Exercise or a program of exercises to strengthen specific muscles or shape the figure by pitting one muscle or part of the body against another or against an immovable object in a strong but motionless action. Isometric exercises are done without changing the length of the muscles. These exercises work on the muscles in a static position and demand muscle tension without any actual movement. Most of the core conditioning exercises, yoga postures, and even pilates exercises are isometric.
